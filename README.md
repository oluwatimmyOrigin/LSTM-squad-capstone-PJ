# LSTM-squad-capstone-PJ
capstone project by the LSTM Squad ::: this repository showcases a deep learning solution using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for time-series forecasting / sequential data analysis. Built as part of a collaborative program capstone, it demonstrates data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.
